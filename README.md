This repository contains the build created using Unity for our participation in the Third Web and Build Alliance hackathon.

This experience features a top-down shooter game set in the Ethereans Fantastic Universe, where you play as a valiant Cryptling Soldier receiving direct orders from the Military commanders to thwart the invasion of an unidentified force rumored to be called the Misfits.

For the mission to be successful, you need to complete two main quests. The first is to verify your identity by connecting your Web3 Wallet, and the second equally important task is to eliminate the invading waves of enemies aiming to plunder the Empire's treasures.

We are using Third Web Unity Package 4.6.4
